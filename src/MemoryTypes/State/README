- How should stats be handled?

For now, each state will keep track of its own stats, and the result will be added to the device when switching states. For example, the Reading state adds 1 read to the stats, so it returns a StatBlock containing 1 'read'.

- How should the bus be handled?

The bus (or buses in general) require 2-way communication. Commands go in, responses come out. The state of the bus at each cycle is crucial to verification. What design pattern allows for 2-way communication across a medium? Mediator. Any device using a bus can simply keep a reference to the bus. If 2 devices try to drive the bus in the same cycle, we can throw an exception.
